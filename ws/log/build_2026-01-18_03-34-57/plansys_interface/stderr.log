[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findplansys2_pddl_parser.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "plansys2_pddl_parser", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "plansys2_pddl_parser" with any of the following names:

    plansys2_pddl_parserConfig.cmake
    plansys2_pddl_parser-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "plansys2_pddl_parser" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "plansys2_pddl_parser_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "plansys2_pddl_parser" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
